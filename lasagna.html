                <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
                <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>

                <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>  
              <ol>
                <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic 
                    over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
                    tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, 
                    fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 
                    2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
                     stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
                    lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain 
                    noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine 
                    ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of 
                    a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
                     sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
                      with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups
                       meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan
                        cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and 
                        Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
                         spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not
                          touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an 
                    additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>          
              </ol>
