                <li>1 tablespoon smoked sweet paprika</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf, fresh or dried</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>1/2 cup hot sauce</li>
                <li>1 can tomato sauce (15 oz)</li>
                <li>1 can stewed, fire roasted or crushed tomatoes (15 oz)</li>
                <li>1 sack tortilla chips, lightly crushed</li>
                <li>3/4 pound Maytag blue cheese, crumbled</li>
                <li>A handful of flat leaf parsley, chopped</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>  
              <ol>
                <li>Place a large pot over medium-high heat with the EVOO, 
                    2 turns of the pan. Add the ground chicken and break it 
                    up, lightly browning it for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the carrots, onion, celery, garlic, paprika and bay 
                    leaf and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring 
                    frequently, for about 7-8 minutes. Add the chicken stock 
                    and scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the hot sauce, tomato sauce and the stewed, fire-roasted
                     or crushed tomatoes to the chili and bring up to a bubble.
                      Simmer for 8-10 minutes more to let the flavors come
                       together.</li>
                <li>While the chili is simmering, pre-heat the broiler.</li>
                <li>Spread the chips out on a cookie sheet. Top with the 
                    crumbled blue cheese and transfer to the oven to melt the
                     cheese, 2-3 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle 
                     with the chopped parsley.</li>
                <li>Top each serving of Buffalo Chicken Chili with a few 
                    blue cheese chips.</li>
